# tippin

tippin is a tip calculator iOS app built with Swift. The app helps you split the bill easily amongst your friends.
<br><br>

# Why

•  I needed an app for this whenever I would dine with friends. The other tip calculator apps available were not modern and visually pleasing, which made me reluctant to use it.<br>
•  I wanted to build a product from beginning to end, from design to development to release. I believe this would give me greater knowledge of what it takes to bring an idea from scratch to a live entity.
